        The primary purpose of the canteen automation system is to save time and also to ensure effective and efficient management of canteens. The system has been categorized into two main software components which include android application and web application. The web application is the platform by which the users of the canteen interact with the system and the android application is the means by which the customers interact with the canteen. The two software components do no directly communicate but instead they both have access to the Apache localhost server. Both application query, update and access the database through the web server.
